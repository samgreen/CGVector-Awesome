CGVector-Awesome
================

This library has been ported to [Swift](https://github.com/samgreen/CGVector-Awesome-Swift)

Additions to CoreGraphics CGVector, most useful with Apple's SpriteKit

Methods
```
/* Create a vector from the given point */
CG_INLINE CGVector CGVectorFromPoint(CGPoint pt);

/* Add two vectors */
CG_INLINE CGVector CGVectorSum(CGVector vector1, CGVector vector2);

/* Subtract two vectors */
CG_INLINE CGVector CGVectorDifference(CGVector vector1, CGVector vector2);

/* Multiply two vectors */
CG_INLINE CGVector CGVectorMultiply(CGVector vector1, CGVector vector2);

/* Multiply a vector by a single scalar */
CG_INLINE CGVector CGVectorMultiplyByScalar(CGVector vector, CGFloat scalar);

/* Normalize a vector. This scales the length of the vector to 1 */
CG_INLINE CGVector CGVectorNormalize(CGVector vector);

/* Creates a vector perpendicular to `vector` */
CG_INLINE CGVector CGVectorMakePerpendicular(CGVector vector);

/* Calculate the angle of between two vectors */
CG_INLINE CGFloat CGVectorAngleBetween(CGVector vector1, CGVector vector2);

/* Calculate the angle of `vector` */
CG_INLINE CGFloat CGVectorAngle(CGVector vector);

/* Calculate the angle of `vector` for use with a SpriteKit zRotation property */
CG_INLINE CGFloat CGVectorAngleSK(CGVector vector);

/* Calculate the dot product of two vectors */
CG_INLINE CGFloat CGVectorDotProduct(CGVector vector1, CGVector vector2);

/* Calculate the magnitude (length) of a vector */
CG_INLINE CGFloat CGVectorLength(CGVector vector);

/* Calculate the distance between two vectors */
CG_INLINE CGFloat CGVectorDistance(CGVector vectorStart, CGVector vectorEnd);

/* Determine if two vectors are equal */
CG_INLINE bool __CGVectorEqualToVector(CGVector vector1, CGVector vector2);

/* Determine if two vectors are perpendicular */
CG_INLINE bool __CGVectorPerpendicularToVector(CGVector vector1, CGVector vector2);
```
